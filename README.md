# PatGPT

https://llm.patrickring.net/

PatGPT is a highly customized proxy layer built upon a Cloudflare Worker designed to reroute and enhance the functionality of DuckDuckGo's AI chat features (Duck.ai). This project rebrands the service, enforces specific client-side behaviors, injects custom styles, and provides robust error handling and configuration overrides.

## üöÄ Core Architecture and Proxying

The project operates as an intermediary proxy, handling all requests destined for the custom host and routing them to the target service while applying extensive transformations [1].

### Proxy Configuration
*   **Host Mapping:** Requests targeting the worker's host (`llm.patrickring.net`) are internally mapped and proxied to the official **`duckduckgo.com`** [1]. The primary `targetHost` is set to `'duckduckgo.com'` [1].
*   **Special Request Interception:**
    *   Requests involving `/cdn-cgi/rum` are immediately intercepted and returned with a 204 status response [2].
    *   Requests for standard icons (favicon, apple touch icons, etc.) are intercepted and served a hardcoded favicon from `https://www.minecraft.net/etc.clientlibs/minecraftnet/clientlibs/clientlib-site/resources/favicon.ico` [2, 3].
    *   Requests to `/duckchat/v1/status` are modified to include a dynamic timestamp query parameter (`?time=${new Date().getTime()}`) [3, 4].

### Header and Caching Management
The worker meticulously cleans, transforms, and sets various headers for improved security and performance:
*   **Header Filtering:** Sensitive headers matching `/proto|policy|x.frame.options|x.xss.protection/i` are removed from both incoming requests and outgoing responses [5, 6]. The `referer` header is also skipped if the request host relates to 'archive' [6].
*   **Host Replacement:** Host names defined in `hostMap` are substituted with the `targetHost` in request headers [6] and the reverse substitution is performed in response headers [2].
*   **User Agent:** A specific mobile user-agent string (`Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 17_7_0 like Mac OS X)...`) is enforced on all proxied requests [5].
*   **Aggressive Caching:** Standard caching headers (`vary`, `etag`, `nel`, `pragma`, `cf-ray`) are deleted [5]. Specific headers like `CDN-Cache-Control` and `Cache-Control` are set [1], applying a cache lifespan of **30 seconds for requests** [6] and **33 seconds for successful responses** [7, 8].

## ‚ú® Customizations and Feature Overrides

### 1. Branding and Content Replacement (Server-Side)
The worker applies several string replacements in the response body if the content is text-based (text, html, script, xml, json) [9]:
*   All occurrences of the target host (`targetHostRe`) are replaced with the original host (`thisHost`) [9].
*   All occurrences of `'Duck.ai'` and `'DuckDuckGo'` are replaced with **`'PatGPT'`** [9].
*   The phrase `'Ask privately'` is replaced with **`'Ask anything'`** [9].
*   Mobile meta tags are modified: `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` content is changed from `"no"` to `"yes"` [7], and specific internal settings related to showing Apple App Store ads are set to `false` (`"showAppleAppStoreAds":false`) [7].

### 2. Custom Frontend Behavior Injection (Worker-Side Script)
The worker injects a proprietary `<script>` block into the returned HTML [10]:
*   **Auto-Redirection:** If the user lands on the root path (`/`) without search parameters (`location.search===''`), they are immediately redirected to the **AI Chat query page** (`/?q=DuckDuckGo+AI+Chat&ia=chat&duckai=1`) [11, 12].
*   **Interface Overrides (DOM):** Prototype methods for DOM insertion (`append`, `appendChild`, etc.) are modified to set a `text` attribute on appended elements based on their string content [10, 11].
*   **Button Utility:** An event listener is added to inserted buttons, removing the **`disabled` attribute on mouseover** [11].
*   **Persistent Configuration (`localStorage`):** Several critical settings are forced via `localStorage` [12, 13]:
    *   Terms are auto-agreed (`duckaiHasAgreedToTerms: 'true'`) [12].
    *   The assistant name is set to **"PatGPT"** within `duckaiCustomization` [12].
    *   The preferred AI model is configured (`preferredDuckaiModel: '203'`) [12].
    *   AI chat promotions are programmatically dismissed with the current date [12].
    *   Approximate location usage is enabled (`duckaiCanUseApproxLocation: 'true'`) [13].
    *   Prompt suggestions are hidden (`aiChatPromptSuggestions: '{"hideSuggestions":true}'`) [13].
    *   A `setInterval` runs every 100ms to click a specific button (likely an alert or dark/light mode toggle) if found [13].
*   **External Script Injection:** An external script, `fetch.js`, is fetched and injected into the HTML [13].

### 3. Visual Customizations (CSS Injection)
A dedicated `<style>` block is injected to modify the appearance and hide unwanted elements [14]:
*   **UI Hiding:** Numerous elements related to help pages, settings, specific UI sections, app store links (`apps.apple.com`, `play.google.com`), the "4o-mini" button, and various feedback/privacy elements are hidden using `display:none !important` [14-16].
*   **Text Styling:** Headings (`h1`-`h6`), strong tags, and the first letter of list items and paragraphs are styled using `text-transform:capitalize` [16].
*   **Global Filter:** A **`filter:hue-rotate(-45deg)`** is applied to the entire HTML document [16].

### 4. Client-Side API Manipulation (`fetch.js` - Injected Script)
The external `fetch.js` script overrides core browser APIs for advanced runtime control [4]:
*   **Global `fetch` Override:** The global `fetch` function is wrapped [4].
    *   **Tracking Prevention:** Requests to specific service domains (`improving.llm.patrickring.net`, `quack.llm.patrickring.net`, `privacy-pro-eligible.json`) are intercepted and provided an empty successful JSON response (`{}`) [17].
    *   **LLM Model Enforcement:** All `/duckchat/v1/chat` requests are intercepted. The request body is modified to **force the LLM model to `'gpt-5-mini'`** and ensure `WebSearch` is set to `true` in the metadata [17, 18].
*   **Token Management:** The `'x-vqd-hash-1'` token is extracted from successful responses and stored in `sessionMap` (session storage/Map) for later use [18, 19].
*   **Robust Error Spoofing:** If a chat request fails (non-200 status code [18] or throws an error [19]), the override constructs a synthetic successful `text/event-stream` response. This response includes the error message (or status text) formatted as a message from the assistant, using the stored `'x-vqd-hash-1'` token [19, 20].
*   **Image Source Correction:** The setter for `HTMLImageElement.prototype.src` is modified to fix a specific hostname typo, replacing `'external-content.llm.patrickring.net'` with `'external-content-llm.patrickring.net'` [21].
*   **Tracking Shutdown:** The `navigator.sendBeacon` function is overridden to immediately return `true`, effectively **disabling client-side reporting** [22].

## üõ£Ô∏è Future Development

*   **Request/Response Caching:** Integration of a **vector database for request/response caching** is intended to drastically reduce latency and reliance on the upstream service for redundant queries.
